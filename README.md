# Otter Sign up form!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It makes use of TypeScript, React Hooks, the Material-UI library, FontAwesome and axios.

This project is a single page web application which allows users to 'request an invitation' via a form in a modal.

Users are able to click a CTA, which then opens a modal containing a form. The form requires 'name', 'email' and confirm email' to be filled in.

This form performs validation, which will display any errors to the user and prevent the form from being completed.

If all validation is passed, the form makes a mock API, during this mock API call a loading state is displayed.

The modal then displays a success message which allows the user to close it via a CTA.

The form contains keyboard focus accessibility.
